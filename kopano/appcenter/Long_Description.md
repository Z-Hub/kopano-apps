## Kopano - One-Click-App

Kopano is more than just a groupware. Its basic functions are expanded with new components that complement your everyday business communication in a natural way.

### What do you get with this app?

This app is just a simple way to automatically install the the most used Kopano apps in one go. This app installs [Kopano Core](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-core), [Kopano WebApp](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-webapp) and [Z-Push for Kopano](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:z-push-kopano).

If you want to spread out your installation to multiple hosts, then you can just skip the installation of this app and install [Kopano Core](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-core), [Kopano WebApp](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-webapp) and [Z-Push for Kopano](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:z-push-kopano) individually.

#### Which Edition of Kopano do the apps provide?

Kopano is evolving very fast and delivers updates on a regular basis. While owners of a valid subscription receive these updates via our repositories, users of the free Univention app are bound to the packages included in the app (the free other app is otherwise not limited in the amount of users or features available). We do our best to update our apps once every 6 to 9 months.

In addition to this owners of a valid subscriptions are able to get in direct contact with our [support](https://kopano.com/support-info/).

### Why is Kopano your new Communication & Sharing solution?

*   ... because you access your data with a lean, platform-independent [DeskApp](https://kopano.com/products/deskapp/?lang=en) from Windows, Mac and Linux desktops.
*   ... because you can use a compatible WebApp with almost all browsers that the DeskApp looks like.
*   ... because you are using [Outlook from Version](https://kopano.com/kopano-outlook-extension-available-final/) to connect devices such as smartphones, tablets or even Windows devices via Z- Push (Open Source ActiveSync).
*   ... because there are many other reasons. Try it out!

### Whether we made Kopano for you?

Yes. If you are an organization or group of any kind or size that communicates with each other in the same room, Kopano is made for you!

Kopano's modular architecture, coupled with easy management through the web-based UCS management system, makes it the ideal groupware solution for two, three, five or 50,000 subscribers. The management of the server, supported by the integration specifically developed for UCS, is implemented entirely by UCS's integrated user management and the UCS management system. A look at the Linux console is no longer necessary for everyday work.
