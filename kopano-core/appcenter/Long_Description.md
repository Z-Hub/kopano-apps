## Kopano Core  

Kopano is more than just a groupware. Its basic functions are expanded with new components that complement your everyday business communication in a natural way.

### What do you get with this app?

This is the base app of the Kopano Sharing & Communication software. It includes the core components, such as the database, backup and management tools, as well as the necessary components for full integration into the Univention Corporate Server user management (UCS) and mail delivery. Users and resources are managed centrally in the UCS management system.

Please also install the [Kopano WebApp](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-webapp) and [Z-Push for Kopano](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:z-push-kopano)!

### Why is Kopano your new Communication & Sharing solution?

*   ... because you access your data with a lean, platform-independent [DeskApp](https://kopano.com/products/deskapp/?lang=en) from Windows, Mac and Linux desktops.
*   ... because you can use a compatible WebApp with almost all browsers that the DeskApp looks like.
*   ... because you are using [Outlook from Version](https://kopano.com/kopano-outlook-extension-available-final/) to connect devices such as smartphones, tablets or even Windows devices via Z- Push (Open Source ActiveSync).
*   ... because there are many other reasons. Try it out!

### Whether we made Kopano for you?

Yes. If you are an organization or group of any kind or size that communicates with each other in the same room, Kopano is made for you!

Kopano's modular architecture, coupled with easy management through the web-based UCS management system, makes it the ideal groupware solution for two, three, five or 50,000 subscribers. The management of the server, supported by the integration specifically developed for UCS, is implemented entirely by UCS's integrated user management and the UCS management system. A look at the Linux console is no longer necessary for everyday work.
