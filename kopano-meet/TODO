# Todos and ideas for later versions


## Needs investigation

## Needed improvements in Konnect and/or Meet

- logging out out Meet logs the user directly back in
  - Meet needs to gain the possibility to logout directly at the external provider

## later

- make it possible to also use the app with the Kopano backend
- add configuration of an own turn server to the univention settings page
- [*] make it possible to use a differing domain name
  - [*] content from override file
  - [*] https://stash.z-hub.io/projects/K4U/repos/kopano-apps/browse/kopano-meet/preinst#48-52
  - [*] registration at external oidc needs to match new domain name
- [ ] change the url of the bundled konnect from /kopanoid to /meetid
  - requires changes to kopano_web for proxying -> https://github.com/zokradonh/kopano-docker/pull/320
