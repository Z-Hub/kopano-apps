## Kopano is more than just a groupware. Its basic functions are expanded with new components that complement your everyday business communication in a natural way.  

Z-Push is an open source application that brings your groupware data to ActiveSync-compatible devices such as smartphones, tablets, or Outlook 2013 and more. With more than 8 years experience with different backends, Z-Push is the leading solution in this field.

### What do you get with this app?

This app contains Z-Push for Kopano. Everything is completely preconfigured for Univention Corporate Server (UCS). After installation, only an ActiveSync / "Exchange" account has to be created on the device and the personal access data and the address of the UCS server must be entered.

To use the app, you also need the [Kopano Core app](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-core).

Note: To display the global address book (users, groups, and contacts on the UCS server) in the Kopano OL Extension, the GAB sync script must still be configured. Please refer to the documentation for the necessary steps!

### Why is Kopano your new Communication & Sharing solution?

*   ... because you access your data with a lean, platform-independent DeskApp from Windows, Mac as well as Linux desktops.
*   ... because you can use a WebApp with almost all desktop browsers, which looks just like the DeskApp.
*   ... because you are using devices such as smartphones, tablets or even Windows devices with [Outlook (starting with version 2013)](https://kopano.com/kopano-outlook-extension-available-final/) to connect via Z-Push (Open Source ActiveSync).
*   ... because there are many other reasons. Try it out!

### Whether we made Kopano for you?

Yes. If you are an organization or group of any kind or size that communicates with each other in the same room, Kopano is made for you!

Kopano's modular architecture, coupled with easy management through the web-based UCS management system, makes it the ideal groupware solution for two, three, five or 50,000 subscribers. The management of the server, supported by the integration specifically developed for UCS, is implemented entirely by UCS's integrated user management and the UCS management system. A look at the Linux console is no longer necessary for everyday work.
