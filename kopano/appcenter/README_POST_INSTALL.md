If you have a Kopano subscription you can easily keep up to date with the newest Kopano releases. For this you click on the `App Settings` button in the Univention App Center and easily configure the desired repository from there.

Once the repository has been activated updates can easily be installed by going to `Software update` and the executing `check for package updates`.

You can read more information about this in the [Kopano4UCS documentation](https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/K4U/Updating+Kopano+packages+directly+from+the+Kopano+download+server).
