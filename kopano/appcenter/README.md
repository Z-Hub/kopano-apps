Welcome to the Kopano Univention apps!
======================================

The installation the Kopano apps was successful and you are only a few steps away from using Kopano.

Kopano does not bring a default user, instead users are completely managed through the [user module of the Univention Management Console](#module=udm:users/user:0:).

Please have a look at the [Kopano4UCS Wiki](https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/K4U) and especially the [Getting Started](https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/K4U/Documentation+-+Getting+Started)Â page for more information.
