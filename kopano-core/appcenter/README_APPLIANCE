Welcome to your new Kopano Appliance! This appliance is preconfigured
you can already send internal e-mails. The sending of external e-mails
takes place via SMTP, which may still need to be configured in your
network
([SMTP-Auth](http://docs.software-univention.de/manual-4.2.html#mail::serverconfig::relay))
or forwarded in your filewall (firewall port 25).

The Kopano WebApp, Z-Push and Web Meetings are already set up. In order
to log in there, please create at least one user of the type "Kopano
Account" via the system and domain settings. Then go back to the start
page and start your test of the Kopano Apps.

Have fun!
