## Kopano Konnect

Kopano is more than just a groupware. Its basic functions are expanded with new components that complement your everyday business communication in a natural way.

### What do you get with this app?

Konnect is a new project that implements an OpenID (Connect) provider. It can be used to allow users to authenticate within applications, that support this standard, in a secure way. That is: without having to share their password, and while keeping control of what data is shared with the application. Support for the OpenID Connect standard is growing quickly: many applications have introduced support using a plugin or by including it in their core products. 

Konnect is a required for applications using the RestAPI provided by Kopano, but is of course also interesting to integrate external applications that support OpenID Connect. Check the [Kopano documentation](https://documentation.kopano.io/kopanocore_administrator_manual/configure_kc_components.html#configure-3rd-party-applications-to-authenticate-using-konnect) on how to configure selected third party applications for Kopano Konnect. Konnect needs to be installed on the same system as [Kopano Core](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-core).

#### Which Edition of Kopano do the apps provide?

Kopano is evolving very fast and delivers updates on a regular basis. While owners of a valid subscription receive these updates via our repositories, users of the Univention app are bound to the packages included in the app (the free app is otherwise not limited in the amount of users or features available). We do our best to update our apps once every 6 to 9 months.

In addition to this owners of a valid subscriptions are able to get in direct contact with our [support](https://kopano.com/support-info/).

### Why is Kopano your new Communication & Sharing solution?


*   ... because you access your data with a lean, platform-independent DeskApp from Windows, Mac as well as Linux desktops.
*   ... because you can use a WebApp with almost all desktop browsers, which looks just like the DeskApp.
*   ... because you are using devices such as smartphones, tablets or even Windows devices with [Outlook (starting with version 2013)](https://kopano.com/kopano-outlook-extension-available-final/) to connect via Z-Push (Open Source ActiveSync).
*   ... because there are many other reasons. Try it out!

### Whether we made Kopano for you?

Yes. If you are an organization or group of any kind or size that communicates with each other in the same room, Kopano is made for you!

Kopano's modular architecture, coupled with easy management through the web-based UCS management system, makes it the ideal groupware solution for two, three, five or 50,000 subscribers. The management of the server, supported by the integration specifically developed for UCS, is implemented entirely by UCS's integrated user management and the UCS management system. A look at the Linux console is no longer necessary for everyday work.
