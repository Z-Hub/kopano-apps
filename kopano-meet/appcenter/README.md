# Welcome to the Kopano Meet app for UCS!

Kopano Meet makes use of the [OpenID Connect Provider app](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:openid-connect-provider) to allow UCS users to login to Meet.

In the default configuration there is no TURN server configured, so Kopano Meet will only work between users within networks, where direct connections are allowed. If you're interested in using the Kopano TURN services (recommended), please [request access here](https://meet-app.io/free-unsupported-community-package).

Alternatively you can use your own TURN service. Please check the [Meet documentation](https://documentation.kopano.io/kopano_meet_manual/) for instructions for configuring Meet for your own TURN service.
