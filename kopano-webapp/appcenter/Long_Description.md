## Kopano WebApp

Kopano is more than just a groupware. Its basic functions are expanded with new components that complement your everyday business communication in a natural way.

### What do you get with this app?

This app contains the Kopano WebApp, which allows users to easily manage their daily communication and organization tasks, from e-mail, calendar entry, file management, and video calling. The WebApp can be extended with plugins and can be used with different, also customizable themes.

To install Kopano WebApp, the [Kopano Core app](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-core) must already be installed on one or more servers. The Kopano WebApp does not necessarily have to be installed on the same machine. It can also be installed at the same time for load distribution or optimized data communication on several servers. This app is also needed if the Kopano DeskApp is to be used.

#### Which Edition of Kopano do the apps provide?

Kopano is evolving very fast and delivers updates on a regular basis. While owners of a valid subscription receive these updates via our repositories, users of the Univention app are bound to the packages included in the app (the free app is otherwise not limited in the amount of users or features available). We do our best to update our apps once every 6 to 9 months.

In addition to this owners of a valid subscriptions are able to get in direct contact with our [support](https://kopano.com/support-info/).

### Why is Kopano your new Communication & Sharing solution?

*   ... because you can use a compatible WebApp with almost all browsers that the DeskApp looks similar to.

*   ... because there are many other reasons. Try it out!

### Whether we made Kopano for you?

Yes. If you are an organization or group of any kind or size that communicates with each other in the same room, Kopano is made for you!

Kopano's modular architecture, coupled with easy management through the web-based UCS management system, makes it the ideal groupware solution for two, three, five or 50,000 subscribers. The management of the server, supported by the integration developed specifically for Univention Corporate Server (UCS), is entirely managed by UCS's user management and the UCS management system. A look at the Linux console is no longer necessary for everyday work.
