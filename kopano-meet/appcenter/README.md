# Kopano Meet for Univention

App is still a work in progress

Milestone 1:
- get app running with Kopano
- settings dialogue for turn server stuff
- figure out where to upload release containers (for the moment this is using nightly builds)

Milestone 2:
- have the same app also running without Kopano (will likely require changes in the docker containers at https://github.com/zokradonh/kopano-docker/)

Milestone 3:
- get app description ready and add some pictures
