## Meet In A Nutshell

Kopano Meet is a secure, open-source and easy-to-use solution for videoconferencing. It is peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted which means that a conversation always takes place directly between the people in the call, with no other parties in between. Kopano Meet was developed as a progressive web app so interaction with Meet feels exactly the same, no matter the device that is used.

### Top Features
