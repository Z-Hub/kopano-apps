Welcome to the Kopano Univention apps!
======================================

The installation of Kopano Groupware Core was successful and you are only a few steps away from using Kopano.

Kopano does not bring a default user, instead users are completely managed through the [user module of the Univention Management Console](#module=udm:users/user:0:).

Please install the [Kopano WebApp](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:kopano-webapp) if you want to access Kopano through your webbrowser or through the [Kopano DeskApp](https://kopano.com/products/deskapp/).

In case you want to connect your mobile devices to Kopano then the installation of the [Z-Push Kopano](#module=appcenter:appcenter:0:id:z-push-kopano) app is recommended as well.

Please have a look at the [Kopano4UCS Wiki](https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/K4U) and especially the [Getting Started](https://wiki.z-hub.io/display/K4U/Documentation+-+Getting+Started)Â page for more information.
