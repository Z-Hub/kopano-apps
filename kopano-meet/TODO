# Todos and ideas for later versions


## Needs investigation

- Join script expects the OpenID app to run on the local system.
  - How to register in the join script, when openid is running somewhere else?

## Needed improvements in Konnect and/or Meet

- logging out out Meet logs the user directly back in
  - Meet needs to gain the possibillity to logout directly at the external provider

## later

- make it possible to also use the app with the Kopano backend
- add configuration of an own turn server to the univention settings page
- make it possible to use a differing domain name
